# OnlyPositiveFigma
A Figma design project I made in a Human-Computer Interaction course.

Basic idea of the app concept is a positive news site which is actually a social media app. Users are able to post positive news stories to other users and be able to like and comment on other people posts,

Here is the project's link so you can view it:

Idea in this course was to make a prototype with 5 functionalities. 

I got a perfect 100/100 grade for my HCI course.

Here is the Google Docs I made with notes on testing, description what the app is, paper prototype and every screen and functionality explained. 

ANYONE WITH THE LINK CAN VIEW IT EVEN WITHOUT SIGNING INTO GOOGLE
